## Executive Summary

AgentSeed introduces a minimalist yet powerful archetype for generating autonomous agents using `.prompy` files as declarative intent interfaces. The core concept is that any agent can be "seeded" from a short, structured description, interpreted by large language models (LLMs) to yield complete, self-documenting, executable Python scripts. This drastically lowers the barrier to custom automation and represents a significant step forward in natural-language-based programming of intelligent agents.

The key innovation lies in treating `.prompy` files as **intent interfaces**. These files act as "seeds" that grow into fully functional agents. Each seed encapsulates a compact, unambiguous specification of behavior, enabling not just rapid prototyping but also reproducibility, version control, and human readability. Optional fields such as `model`, `inputs`, `author`, and `schedule` allow for richer automation scenarios without sacrificing simplicity.

Unlike prompt-based systems that require manual trial-and-error, or DSLs that introduce steep learning curves, AgentSeed delivers reliable code by standardizing how LLMs interpret user intent. This unlocks agent generation for a broader audience — including non-programmers, educators, researchers, and business users — and ensures that outputs are not merely fragments or suggestions, but full, operational agents aligned with cognitive or functional models (e.g., Perception–Decision–Action).

The architecture of AgentSeed is modular and extensible, comprising layers for input parsing, reasoning, code generation, and integration with real-world interfaces like schedulers or dashboards. Whether monitoring product prices, scraping thematic content, or executing recurring tasks, AgentSeed enables a new paradigm: **software generated by specifying purpose, not implementation**.

By combining the expressiveness of natural language with the precision of structured prompts, AgentSeed positions itself as a candidate standard for next-generation agent development — grounded in clarity, built for autonomy, and optimized for human-computer collaboration.
